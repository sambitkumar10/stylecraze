    <h4>Medically Reviewed By Dr. Madhuri Agarwal , MBBS, MD (Dermatology) Dermatologist,Cosmetic Dermatology </h4><br>
    <p style="color: black;">February 22, 2022 Written By Jyotsana Rao</p><br>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;"> If you love to style your hair but are worried about the multiple side effects of hair gels, worry not! We are here to help you understand major issues with hair gels and how you can circumvent them. Most of us strive for an elegant, neat, and appropriate appearance throughout the day. It comprises good attire, a well-done face, and neatly styled hair. Hair is one of the most important aspects of a person’s personality and looks, but it is also difficult to maintain. Hair gels take care of the difficult process of properly styling and holding the hair in place.</p><br>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;"> Hair gels are hair styling treatments that harden and manage the hair into various hairstyles. Historical research shows that people have utilized natural hair gels since the ancient Egyptian and Greco-Roman periods. But, the conventional hair gel was produced in the 1960s by Luis Montoya of the U.S.A. and sold under the brand name DEP, which stood for the main ingredient in the product, diethyl phthalate, that gave it its distinct non-sticky texture. Ordinary gels are primarily made up of cationic polymers, which have positive charges that give the gel its stiffness, allowing it to easily bond to the hair shaft, letting it flex and keep its place for extended periods. </p><br>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">These gels aid in hairstyling, making hairstyles last longer, improving their texture, giving tresses a pleasant sleek look, making the hair and face look presentable and groomed, and boosting an individual’s overall persona. But on the other hand, hair gels are considered to have negative consequences on the hair, scalp, and body due to the presence of toxic chemicals. The following are some of the negative consequences of hair gel. Keep reading. </p><br><br>
    <h2>Hair Gel Side Effects</h2><br>
    <h3>1. Drying and dehydrating the hair:</h3><br>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">Hair gels contain alcohol and corrosive chemicals that strip off moisture from the hair and scalp and make them dry and dehydrated. These gels mess with the moisture levels and reduce the production of sebum creating dry, brittle and breakage prone hair and give rise to problems of itchy and flaky scalp. They make the hair frizzy, thereby giving rise to unmanageable, dry, rough, limp and lustreless tresses.</p><br>
    <h3>2. Hair Loss:</h3><br>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">These gels dehydrate the hair and scalp, thereby making the hair prone to breakage and fall. The chemical compounds present in these gels along with external pollutants together react with the dead cell build up and excess sebum on the scalp. This clogs the hair follicles and eventually causes hair fall. Excess and prolonged hair fall can lead to problems like receding hair line, baldness etc.</p><br>
    <h3>3. Dandruff:</h3><br>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">A dehydrated, undernourished and infected scalp is characterized by irritation, itchiness and flakiness of the scalp leading to dandruff. Improper production of sebum, unhealthy and clogged skin pores and hair follicles, weakened hair roots all together cause and aggravate the problem of dandruff, Seborrhoeic dermatitis or inflammation in the scalp which can further lead to other skin diseases like acne.</p><br>
    <h3>4. Discoloration and damage:</h3><br>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">Damage, split ends, thinning, and discoloration of hair are also common side effects of using hair gels. These gels rip off the nourishment and moisture content of the hair, break and strip them, disturb the pH balance of the hair and make them unhealthy, scarce and dull. Harmful chemicals in these gels also have ill effects on color treated hair like fading and discoloration and prolonged usage of this gel also results in early graying.</p><br>
